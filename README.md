[00:15.45] I must've died and gone to heaven
[00:17.84] 'Cause it was quarter past eleven
[00:19.98] On a Saturday in 1999
[00:23.93] Right across from where I'm standing
[00:25.92] On the dance floor she was landing
[00:28.04] It was clear that she was from another time
[00:49.54] 
[00:31.70] Like some baby Barbarella
[00:33.88] With the stars as her umbrella
[00:36.07] She asked me if I'd like to magnetise
[00:39.83] Do I have to go star-trekking
[00:41.83] 'Cause it's you I should be checking
[00:43.82] So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes
[01:05.32] 
[00:50.61] She's just a cosmic girl
[00:55.39] From another galaxy
[00:59.01] My heart's at zero gravity
[01:02.63] She's from a cosmic world
[01:07.48] Putting me in ecstasy
[01:11.35] Transmitting on my frequency
[01:15.72] She's cosmic
[01:21.72] 
[01:36.32] I'm scanning all my radars
[01:38.08] Well she said she's from a quasar
[01:40.09] Forty thousand million light years away
[01:44.30] It's a distant solar system
[01:46.13] Tried to phone but they don't list 'em
[01:48.16] So I asked her for her number all the same
[02:09.16] 
[01:51.86] She said, "Step in my transporter
[01:54.49] So I can teleport ya
[01:56.62] All around my heavenly body"
[02:00.08] Oh, this could be a close encounter
[02:02.28] I should take care not to flounder
[02:04.66] Sends me into hyperspace
[02:06.73] When I see her pretty face
[02:19.73] 
[02:11.03] She's just a cosmic girl
[02:15.74] From another galaxy
[02:19.67] My heart's at zero gravity
[02:22.95] She's from a cosmic world
[02:27.99] Putting me in ecstasy
[02:31.58] Transmitting on my frequency
[02:35.93] She's cosmic
[02:41.93] 
[02:40.66] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[02:44.70] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[02:48.97] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[02:52.88] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[03:18.38] 
[02:57.11] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[03:00.87] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[03:04.70] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[03:08.75] Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
[03:34.25] 
[03:15.24] She's just a cosmic girl
[03:19.75] From another galaxy
[03:23.57] Transmitting on her frequency
[03:38.07] 
[03:27.07] Yeah cosmic, oh
[03:30.74] Can't you be my cosmic woman?
[03:34.27] I need you, I want you
[03:38.57] To be my cosmic girl, for the rest of time
[03:43.58] Oh, I'm losing my love
[03:47.03] Oh, my cosmic girl yeah
[03:50.23] She gives me ecstasy
